# Notes
ATRA induces differentiation. TGM2 knockdown affects immunity.

# Dataset Name:
Time course transcriptomic analysis of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-treated NB4 cells.

# Tissue/Cell Line
Immune, leukocytes, APL, NB4 cells (Human)

# Experiments

treated/not-treated ATRA treatment
with/without TGM2

### summary

## ATRA vs Veh | 1 microM 48h
Human NB4 acute promyeloctic leukemia cells were treated with or without 1 microM ATRA for 48 hours.

## ATRA vs Veh | 1 microM, 72h
Human NB4 acute promyeloctic leukemia cells were treated with or without 1 microM ATRA for 72 hours.

## ATRA vs Veh (TGM2 KD) | 1 microM, 48h
Human NB4 acute promelocytic leykemia cells with a stable knockdown of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) were treated with or without 1 microM ATRA for 48 hours.

## ATRA vs Veh (TGM2 KD) | 1 microM, 72h
Human NB4 acute promelocytic leykemia cells with a stable knockdown of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) were treated with or without 1 microM ATRA for 72 hours.

### summary
with/without TGM2
treated/not-treated ATRA

## TGM2 KD vs WT (ATRA) | 1 microM, 48h
Human NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells with a stable knockdown of transgluminase 2 (TGM2 KD) or wild-type NB4 cells were treated with 1 microM of ATRA for 48h.

## TGM2 KD vs WT (ATRA) | 1 microM, 72h
Human NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells with a stable knockdown of transgluminase 2 (TGM2 KD) or wild-type NB4 cells were treated with 1 microM of ATRA for 72h.

## TGM2 KD vs WT
Human NB4 acute promyeloctic leukemia cells with RNAi-mediated knockdown of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2 KD) were compared to wild-type NB4 cells.
